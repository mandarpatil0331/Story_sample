Dear Manager,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writting to request the blocking of a particular money service from my account,related to a course payment.As a valued customer of Axis Bank, I appreciate your attention to this matter.

I recently engaged in a course enrollment process that necessitates financial transactions. However, after thorough consideration and consultation, I have decided to discontinue the use of Varthana used as third party system by crio.do course.
Below are the details of the money service to be blocked:
Money Service Name: Varthana
Account Number: 923010004788925

I understand that this action may require additional documentation or verification. Please inform me of any necessary steps to facilitate this process promptly.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this request. Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me at 9370433713 or mandarpatil0331@gmail.com

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.

Yours sincerely,
